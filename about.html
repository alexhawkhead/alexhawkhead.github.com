		<h4>About me</h4>
    <p>I'm about to begin my final year of a Bachelor of Design with Honours, at Massey University in Wellington, New Zealand.</p>
		<p>When I'm not in front of a computer I take a lot of joy and care in crafting things by hand. I love getting up out of my office chair and getting my hands dirty.</p>
		<p>I am constantly photographing and blogging about my work. Check out my work blog <a href="http://alexshoots.tumblr.com"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>
