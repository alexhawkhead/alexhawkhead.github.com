	<p class="lead">Keepsake</p>
	<p>This was a university project for a graphic design paper. The brief was to conceptualise a design conference of our own chosen topic and to design a brochure &amp; poster to promote it.</p> 
	<div id="description" class="collapse">
		<p>My conference, titled 'Keepsake,' was a multi-disciplinary discussion of designing with the intention to last forever. 
		Playing on that idea, I wrapped my final booklet in tissue paper and placed it in a handmade box with a vinyl sticker on the front. 
		These combined elements were meant to encourage the person who received the box to think of it as something special that they ought to consider keeping. Skills attained: graphic design, branding, copywriting, concept.</p>
		<p>The typeface used is Dan Gneiding's 'Ribbon.'</p>
